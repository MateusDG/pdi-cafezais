## üí° Technical Notes

**Architecture Decisions:**
- HSV color space chosen for better vegetation segmentation
- Configurable sensitivity for field adaptability
- Comprehensive error handling for production readiness
- Professional UI/UX following modern web standards

**Performance Optimizations:**
- Image resizing for processing efficiency
- Memory cleanup and temporary file handling
- Efficient contour processing with area filtering
- Minimal data transfer with structured responses

The Week 1 implementation provides a solid foundation for the coffee plantation analysis system with professional-grade weed detection capabilities and a modern web interface.
